## Chat App

This browser-based chat client allows users to create accounts, login, and chat securely with each other in seperate channels. The UI, at least at the time of writing, is essentially just a simple wireframe as the emphasis, and indeed the motivation for the side-project, was to gain additional exposure to the number of backend implementations required in a modern online chat client, such as:

* Authentication - User account registration/login, password hashing, and storage
* Authorization - Access control and secured APIs
* Real-time messaging - CRUD, push notifications, web sockets

### Possible future features
* E2EE/Asymmetric encryption
* Group chats/channels
